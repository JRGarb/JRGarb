## Hi! I'm Jen 🌻<sub>(*she/her*)<sub>
### Looking for data analysis/science roles from April 2024 😄
I've recently completed the __CoGrammar/HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp__ where I learned to code in python 🐍
and had a great time building a whole new skill set.

### __Some of the things I can do now__:
* Produce sophisticated _data visualisations_ using seaborn and matplotlib.
* _Clean and analyse data_ for useful insights using NumPy and Pandas.
* Create linear and logistic regressions to make predictions using _Machine Learning_ via scikit-learn.
* Conduct _sentiment and polarity analysis_ on text using Natural Language Processing via spaCy and textblob.
* _Query and manage databases_ using SQL and SQLite.
* Streamline code using _Object Oriented Programming_ and user-defined _functions_.

### What else?
* I studied Zoology 🐘 at University, have a Master's in Wildlife Conservation 🐅, and qualified as a science teacher 🧪
* I've worked with bats 🦇 and birds 🐦
* I love to travel, top trips include Yellowstone National Park 🦬 and Mongolia 🐎
